                            Founder, owner & creator of Muse’s Cave, Erendira is a certified life coach and domestic
                            violence
                            counselor by trade. From the time she was a child, she had always been fascinated by helping
                            others
                            in any way she could, so when she found out that being a life coach could be a feasible
                            career path,
                            she jumped at the chance to make it hers. As an immigrant, Erendira did not have much
                            guidance
                            forging a life for herself in America, so she takes pride in what she has created and the
                            ways she
                            is able to give back.

                            A true perfectionist, Erendira is an enneagram type four (leaning one) and constantly
                            strives for
                            the best both in her personal and professional worlds. She is motivated daily by the love
                            she is
                            blessed to have from her family and friends and her constant desire to let go of old habits
                            that no
                            longer serve her. A true proponent of positivity, Erendira prides herself on the ability to
                            transform hard situations of life into a positive lesson. The people around her describe her
                            as
                            wise, strong and powerful; traits she brings into running Muse’s Cave and serving as a haven
                            for
                            creatives.

                            Another way Erendira loves serving people is through the power of food. She loves to cook
                            and eat
                            Mexican food and gets so much joy from watching those she loves, eat what she’s made. The
                            ones
                            closest to her always say she should own her own restaurant, too. She loves the color red
                            because it
                            represents love, passion and boldness; a true representation for the way Erendira strives to
                            live
                            her life. In her free time, she likes to spend self-reflecting moments alone, enjoying wine,
                            reading, or learning something new. She has also always had a passion for music (especially
                            oldies).

                            Erendira is wise, strong, insightful and intuitive and focuses deeply on high quality
                            control. She
                            strives to be the best version of herself at all times and pushes for the same type of
                            experience
                            through Muse’s Cave. She believes that everyone has the power to better themselves through
                            bravery
                            and hardwork and she loves owning a space where many creative individuals can take the first
                            step
                            towards that.
