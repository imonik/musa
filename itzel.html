                            Itzel is a nineteen-year-old female Chicana who is a freshman in college, planning to major
                            in dance. From Fremont, California, she takes pride in knowing the community and space
                            around Muse’s Cave and loves that it is a space for people to house their passions. When she
                            was a sophomore in high school, Itzel realized her passion for dance at the time she was
                            asked to choreograph for a school event called “Ritmo Latino”; a showcase of Latin dances.
                            With a mostly Asian high school population, Itzel had always watched the Latin dances garner
                            almost no attention, so she made it her mission to have the dance be both fun to watch but
                            also culturally accurate.

                            From that day on, Itzel’s passion for dance and what it could teach about a community grew
                            stronger every second. She idolized people who followed their passion for dancing, like her
                            dance teacher at school, and looked up to multiple LA choreographers. Currently in community
                            college, she plans to transfer to UCLA for dance in the next two years.

                            She loves true, authentic, Mexican food like “ribs in chipotle sauce” and “barbacoa with
                            pickled cabbage”. Her favorite color is the color of royalty, a.k.a., purple and she spends
                            her free time with her friends, playing plants vs. zombies, or watching things on YouTube.
                            As someone who loves rhythm, the music she listens to always includes beats with African
                            and/or Latin sounds. When she listens to music like that, her body just starts moving on its
                            own and she gets a complete energy boost. She enjoys using Muse’s Cave as a space to express
                            that and watch others do the same.
